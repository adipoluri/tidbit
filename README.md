## 📖 What is TidBit?
TidBit is the browser extension that makes finding answers and completing tasks a breeze. If you find yourself looking for tidbits of information during your day and wish you could just get answers, look no further than TidBit! With TidBit, you can quickly and easily find answers to any question or find instructions for any task, all without leaving your current webpage. Whether you're researching a school project, trying to find a recipe, or looking for advice on what product to buy, TidBit has you covered. Imagine Chat-GPT but in a nice, compact, and practical form! TidBit does more than answer questions though, TidBit can summarize your notes for you, and even create new practice questions that can help you study for that upcoming test! You can also have a little fun with TidBit and joke around with harV, TidBit's very own AI Comedian.
